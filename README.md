# Adaptive Traffic Signal Control using LSTM and Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the implementation of an AI-driven smart traffic signal control system. It integrates **LSTM-based traffic flow forecasting** with a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** reinforcement learning agent for real-time signal optimization in a simulated traffic environment using **SUMO**.

## Project Overview

Urban traffic congestion is a major challenge due to growing population and infrastructure limits. This project proposes a modular framework that:

- Predicts short-term traffic flow using **LSTM**
- Uses predictions to train a **DQN agent** to optimize signal timing
- Simulates traffic behavior and control using **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)**
